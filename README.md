# lambda-dynamodb
This project implements a serverless web application that allows users to submit a contact form, which stores the data securely in an AWS DynamoDB table. The solution is fully hosted on AWS using API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB, with HTML/CSS frontend embedded directly in the Lambda response for seamless deployment.
